In the 1990s, computers gained popularity, leading to the birth of Information Technology (IT) in the 21st century. IT investments, including computers, networks, software, and employees, are crucial for organizations.
Charles Babbage is credited with creating the first mechanical computer in the 1820s, marking the beginning of information technology's history in computer hardware and software. In 1946, the University of Pennsylvania announced the first programmable, general-purpose computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), weighing 30 tons and occupying 1800 square feet. 
The ENIAC, a crucial tool for modern programmers, was capable of reading input data, holding information in memory, executing programming instructions, creating sub-programs, and printing output. Operating systems developed and the shared tasks in a computer were merged into operating systems, which serve as the computer's brain and manage all its components. In 1971, AT&T developed Unix, a rapidly evolving operating system, which was widely distributed worldwide, helped by top computer scientists and engineers. Unix, Linux, and Windows are widely used operating systems globally due to their powerful capabilities and low costs. 
In the mid-1980s, Microsoft introduced user-friendly software like Microsoft Windows, Excel, and Word, along with inexpensive hardware. Having arrived on the internet, network effects appeared as networks expanded, allowing users to connect to more people within a village. This free increase in community benefit is known as the network effect. This led to the development of computer networking technology, the Internet, and the World Wide Web, which are closely associated with the growth of networks. 
The Internet connects small networks within buildings, known as Local Area Networks (LANs), and large networks, known as Wide Area Networks (WANs), which are typically worked by Internet providers like Verizon, Frontier, and Spectrum. LANs enable computers to share files, emails, printers, and the Internet connection within offices. Windows was the personal computer era's dominant operating system, but Apple's iOS and Google's Android are dominant in the mobile era, both tracing their lineage to Unix.
